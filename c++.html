    <h1>Introduction to C++</h1>
    <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of C++</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> C++ supports classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C++ is known for its high performance, making it suitable for system/software development and resource-intensive applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Template Library (STL):</strong> C++ includes a powerful library of template classes and functions for data structures and algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-Level Manipulation:</strong> C++ allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory, providing greater control over system resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility with C:</strong> C++ is compatible with C, allowing developers to use existing C libraries and code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple example of C++ code:</p>
    <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, C++!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Common C++ Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Encapsulation of data and methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Deriving new classes from existing ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Ability to treat objects of different classes through a common interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Templates:</strong> Creating generic functions and classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>C++ is a versatile and powerful language that is widely used in software development, game development, and systems programming, among other fields.</p>
