    <h1>Comprehensive Note on JavaScript Programming Language</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its versatility and interactivity. Developed by Brendan Eich, JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, event-driven, and object-oriented programming. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, particularly in web development.</p>
    
    <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      1995: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. Initially named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript.
      <br>
      1996: JavaScript 1.0 was released, becoming a key component of web browsers.
      <br>
      1999: ECMAScript 3 was standardized, introducing features like try/catch and regular expressions.
      <br>
      2009: ECMAScript 5 introduced "strict mode" and better support for JSON.
      <br>
      2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was released, introducing significant enhancements, including classes, modules, and arrow functions.
      <br>
      2021: ECMAScript 2021 added new features such as logical assignment operators and Promise.any().
    </p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of JavaScript</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side development.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Variables in JavaScript do not require explicit type declaration.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> JavaScript code is executed line by line in the browser or server.</li>
      <li><strong>Extensive Libraries:</strong> A rich ecosystem with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</li>
      <li><strong>Event-Driven:</strong> JavaScript excels in handling asynchronous events, making it ideal for web applications.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Functions in JavaScript</h4>
    <p>
      <code>
        function functionName(parameters) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return value; // Optional<br>
        }
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        function greet(name) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return `Hello, ${name}!`; <br>
        }<br>
        console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
      </code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <code>
        function calculateSum(...args) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);<br>
        }<br>
        console.log(calculateSum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6<br>
        console.log(calculateSum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)); // Output: 21
      </code>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <code>
        const square = x => x ** 2;<br>
        console.log(square(4)); // Output: 16
      </code>
    </p>
  
    <h1>JavaScript's Ecosystem</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Web Development:</strong> Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.<br>
      <strong>Server-Side Development:</strong> Node.js allows JavaScript to be used on the server.<br>
      <strong>Mobile Development:</strong> Frameworks like React Native enable cross-platform mobile apps.<br>
      <strong>Game Development:</strong> Libraries like Phaser and Three.js facilitate game development.
    </p>
  
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript has evolved into one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, owing to its flexibility, extensive features, and strong community support. Whether for web development, mobile applications, or server-side scripting, JavaScript remains a vital tool for developers of all levels.
