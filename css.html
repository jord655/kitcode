    <h1>Comprehensive Note on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS enhances the visual appearance of web pages by allowing the separation of content from design.</p>
    
    <h2>History of CSS</h2>
    <p>
      1996: CSS1 was introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It provided a basic set of styling options, including font properties, text alignment, and colors.
      <br>
      1998: CSS2 was released, which included support for media types, absolute and relative positioning, and improved layout capabilities.
      <br>
      2001: CSS2.1 became a W3C Recommendation, refining CSS2 by addressing ambiguities and removing inconsistencies.
      <br>
      2011: CSS3 was introduced, bringing modularization that allowed developers to use only the parts they needed. CSS3 included new features such as rounded corners, shadows, gradients, and animations.
      <br>
      Present: CSS continues to evolve with ongoing improvements and new specifications, including Flexbox and Grid for layout, as well as features for responsive design.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of CSS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> CSS separates content from presentation, making it easier to maintain and update.</li>
      <li><strong>Selectors:</strong> CSS provides a powerful set of selectors to target HTML elements based on various criteria (e.g., classes, IDs, attributes).</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS supports media queries, allowing styles to adapt based on device characteristics (screen size, resolution).</li>
      <li><strong>Animations and Transitions:</strong> CSS allows for animations and transitions, enhancing user experience without requiring JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> CSS can be used to style a wide variety of web elements, from simple text to complex layouts.</li>
    </ol>

      <strong>Preprocessors:</strong> Tools like SASS and LESS extend CSS with features like variables and nesting.<br>
      <strong>Responsive Frameworks:</strong> CSS Grid and Flexbox provide powerful layout solutions for responsive designs.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
