    <h1>Introduction to Kotlin</h1>
    <p>Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to be fully interoperable with Java and has become increasingly popular for Android development.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Kotlin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Concise Syntax:</strong> Kotlin reduces boilerplate code, making it easier to read and write.</li>
        <li><strong>Null Safety:</strong> Kotlin's type system is designed to eliminate null pointer exceptions, a common issue in many programming languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use existing Java libraries and frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>Extension Functions:</strong> You can extend existing classes with new functionality without having to inherit from them.</li>
        <li><strong>Coroutines:</strong> Kotlin provides built-in support for asynchronous programming with coroutines, making it easier to handle background tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple example of Kotlin code:</p>
    <pre><code>fun main() {
        val message: String = "Hello, Kotlin!"
        println(message)
    }</code></pre>

    <h2>Why Use Kotlin?</h2>
    <p>Kotlin is favored for its modern features and strong support from Google for Android app development. It helps developers produce safer, cleaner, and more maintainable code.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, Kotlin offers powerful tools and features to enhance your coding experience.</p>
